modern blog app
This is a modern blog application built using React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It utilizes the power of Tailwind CSS, a highly customizable, low-level CSS framework, to create a visually appealing and responsive design. The project also makes use of GraphQL, a query language for your API, which allows for more flexibility and efficiency in data retrieval.

The app allows users to view a list of blog posts, read individual posts, and leave comments. The data is stored in a GraphQL server and can be easily updated, added, or deleted.

This project serves as a great starting point for anyone looking to build a robust blog application or to learn about the latest web development technologies.

Feel free to customize or edit it as per your requirement
